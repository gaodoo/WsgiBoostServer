Mark Twain. The Awful German Language

A little learning makes the whole world kin.
Proverbs XXXII, 7

     I  went often to  look at the collection of curiosities  in  Heidelberg
Castle, and one day  I surprised the  keeper of it with  my German. I  spoke
entirely in that language. He was greatly interested; and after I had talked
a while he said my German was very rare, possibly  a "unique"; and wanted to
add it to his museum.
     If he  had known what it had cost me to acquire  my art,  he would also
have  known that it would  break any collector to buy it.  Harris and I  had
been hard at work  on  our  German  during  several weeks at  that time, and
although  we had  made good progress,  it  had been accomplished under great
difficulty and  annoyance,  for three of our teachers  had died in  the mean
time.  A person  who  has  not  studied German  can form  no idea  of what a
perplexing language it is.
     Surely  there  is  not  another  language  that   is  so  slipshod  and
systemless, and so slippery and elusive to the grasp. One is washed about in
it, hither and thither, in the most helpless way; and when at last he thinks
he has captured a rule which offers  firm  ground to take a rest on amid the
general rage and turmoil of  the ten parts of speech, he turns over the page
and reads, "Let the pupil make careful note of the following EXCEPTIONS." He
runs his eye down and finds that there are more  exceptions to the rule than
instances of it. So overboard he goes again, to hunt for another Ararat  and
find  another quicksand. Such has been, and continues to  be, my experience.
Every time I think I have got one of these four confusing "cases" where I am
master of  it, a seemingly insignificant preposition intrudes itself into my
sentence,  clothed with an  awful and  unsuspected  power,  and crumbles the
ground from under me. For instance, my book inquires after a certain bird --
(it is  always inquiring after things which are of no sort of no consequence
to  anybody):  "Where  is the  bird?"  Now the answer  to  this question  --
according to the book -- is that the bird is waiting in the  blacksmith shop
on account of the rain. Of course no bird would  do that, but then you  must
stick  to the  book. Very well,  I  begin to cipher out the German  for that
answer. I  begin at the wrong end, necessarily, for that is the German idea.
I say to myself, "REGEN (rain) is masculine -- or maybe it is feminine -- or
possibly neuter -- it is too  much  trouble to  look  now. Therefore, it  is
either DER (the) Regen, or DIE (the) Regen, or DAS (the) Regen, according to
which gender it may turn  out to be when I look. In the interest of science,
I will cipher it  out on the hypothesis that it is  masculine. Very well  --
then THE rain is DER Regen, if  it is simply in the quiescent state of being
MENTIONED, without enlargement or discussion -- Nominative case; but if this
rain is  lying around, in a kind of a general  way on the ground, it is then
definitely located, it is  DOING SOMETHING -- that is, RESTING (which is one
of the German grammar's ideas of doing something), and this  throws the rain
into the  Dative  case, and  makes it  DEM Regen. However, this rain is  not
resting,  but is doing something ACTIVELY, -- it is  falling -- to interfere
with the bird, likely -- and this indicates  MOVEMENT, which has the  effect
of  sliding it  into the Accusative  case  and  changing DEM  Regen into DEN
Regen." Having completed the grammatical  horoscope of this matter, I answer
up confidently  and  state  in  German  that  the bird  is  staying  in  the
blacksmith shop  "wegen (on account of) DEN Regen." Then the teacher lets me
softly down with  the  remark  that whenever  the word "wegen"  drops into a
sentence, it ALWAYS  throws that subject into the GENITIVE  case, regardless
of consequences  --  and therefore this  bird stayed  in the blacksmith shop
"wegen DES Regens."
     N.B. -- I was informed, later, by a higher authority, that there was an
"exception"  which permits one to say "wegen DEN  Regen" in certain peculiar
and  complex circumstances,  but that  this  exception  is not  extended  to
anything BUT rain.
